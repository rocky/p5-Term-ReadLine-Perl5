=head1 NAME

Term::ReadLine::Perl5 - A Perl5 implementation GNU Readline

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Term::ReadLine::Perl5;
  $term = new Term::ReadLine::Perl5 'ProgramName';
  while ( defined ($_ = $term->readline('prompt>')) ) {
    ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Overview

This is a implementation of the GNU Readline/History Library written
in Perl5.

GNU Readline reads lines from an interactive terminal with I<emacs> or
I<vi> editing capabilities. It provides as mechanism for saving
history of previous input.

This package typically used in command-line interfaces and REPLs (Read,
Eval, Print, Loop).

=head2 SUBROUTINES

=head3

C<Term::ReadLine::Perl->new($name, [*IN, [*OUT])>

Returns a handle for subsequent calls to readline functions.

C<$name> is the name of the application.

Optionally you can add two arguments for input and output
filehandles. These arguments should be globs.

This routine might also be called via
C<Term::ReadLine->new($term_name)> if other Term::ReadLine packages
like L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> is not available or if you have
C<$ENV{PERL_RL}> set to 'Perl5';

At present, because this code has lots of global state, we currently don't
support more than one readline instance.

Somebody please volunteer to rewrite this code!

=head3 stifle_history

C<stifle_history($max)>

Stifle or put a cap on the history list, remembering only C<$max>
number of lines.

=head3 Minline

C<MinLine([$minlength])>

If C<$minlength> is given, set C<$readline::minlength> the minimum
length a $line for it to go into the readline history.

The previous value is returned.

=head3 remove_history

C<remove_history($which)>

Remove history element C<$which> from the history. The removed
element is returned.

=head1 INSTALL

To install this module type:

    perl Build.PL
    make
    # for interactive testing:
    make test
    # for non-interactive testing
    AUTOMATED_TESTING=1 make test
    make install # might need sudo make install

=head1 DEVELOPMENT HISTORY

The first implementation was in Perl4 (mostly) by Jeffrey
Friedl. He referenced FSF the code Roland Schemers F<line_edit.pl>.

Ilya Zakharevich turned this into a Perl5 module called
L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>. Some of the changes he made include using
L<Term::ReadKey> if present, and made this work under I<xterm>. The
file F<Term/ReadLine/Perl5/CHANGES> up to but not including version
1.04 contains a list of his changes.

Starting with version 1.04 Rocky Bernstein forked the code, adding GNU
readline history. He put it into a public git repository (git) and
also started modernizing it by doing the things CPAN prefers,
including adding POD documentation, non-interactive tests, and
respecting CPAN module namespaces.
