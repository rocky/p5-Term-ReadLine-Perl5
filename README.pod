=head1 NAME

Term::ReadLine::Perl5 - A Perl5 implementation GNU Readline

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Term::ReadLine::Perl5;
  $term = Term::ReadLine::Perl5->new('ProgramName');
  while ( defined ($_ = $term->readline('prompt>')) ) {
    ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Overview

This is a implementation of the GNU Readline/History Library written
in Perl5.

GNU Readline reads lines from an interactive terminal with I<emacs> or
I<vi> editing capabilities. It provides as mechanism for saving
history of previous input.

This package typically used in command-line interfaces and REPLs (Read,
Eval, Print, Loop).

See L<Term::ReadLine::Perl5> for details on the API.

=head2 Demo program

Another package, L<Term::ReadLine::Perl5::Demo|https://metacpan.org/release/ROCKY/Term-ReadLine-Perl5-Demo-0.1> is available to let
you run I<Term::ReadLine::Perl5> to experiment with its capabilities
and show how to use the API.

=head1 INSTALL

To install this module type:

    perl Build.PL
    make
    # for interactive testing:
    make test
    # for non-interactive testing
    AUTOMATED_TESTING=1 make test
    make install # might need sudo make install

=head1 DEVELOPMENT HISTORY

The first implementation was in Perl4 (mostly) by Jeffrey
Friedl. He referenced FSF the code Roland Schemers F<line_edit.pl>.

Ilya Zakharevich turned this into a Perl5 module called
L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>. Some of the changes he made include using
L<Term::ReadKey> if present, and made this work under I<xterm>. The
file F<Term/ReadLine/Perl5/CHANGES> up to but not including version
1.04 contains a list of his changes.

Starting with version 1.04 Rocky Bernstein forked the code, adding GNU
readline history. He put it into a public git repository (github) and
also started modernizing it and doing the things CPAN prefers,
including adding POD documentation and non-interactive tests, removing
(some) type globs, and respecting CPAN module namespaces.
