=head1 Name

Term::ReadLine::Perl5 - A Perl5 implementation GNU Readline

=head2 Overview

This is a implementation of the GNU Readline/History Library written
in Perl5.

GNU Readline reads lines from an interactive terminal with I<emacs> or
I<vi> editing capabilities. It provides as mechanism for saving
history of previous input.

This package typically used in command-line interfaces and REPLs (Read,
Eval, Print, Loop).

=head2 Demo program

Another package, L<Term::ReadLine::Perl5::Demo|https://metacpan.org/release/ROCKY/Term-ReadLine-Perl5-Demo-0.1> is available to let
you run I<Term::ReadLine::Perl5> to experiment with its capabilities
and show how to use the API.

=head1 Synopsis

=head2 Variables

Following GNU Readline/History Library variables can be accessed from
Perl program.  See 'GNU Readline Library Manual' and ' GNU History
Library Manual' for each variable.  You can access them via the
C<Attribs> method.  Names of keys in this hash conform to standard
conventions with the leading C<rl_> stripped.

Example:

    $term = Term::ReadLine::Perl5->new('ReadLineTest');
    $attribs = $term->Attribs;
    $v = $attribs->{history_base};	# history_base

=head3 Attribute Names

	completion_suppress_append (bool)
	history_base               (int)
	history_stifled            (int)
        max_input_history          (int)
	outstream                  (file handle)

=head2 Standard Term::ReadLine Methods

These methods are standard methods defined by
L<Term::ReadLine>.

=head3 C<ReadLine>

    Readline() -> 'Term::ReadLine::Perl5'

returns the actual package that executes the commands. If this package
is used, the value is C<Term::ReadLine::Perl5>.

=cut

sub ReadLine {'Term::ReadLine::Perl5'}


=head3 readline

   $bool = $term->readline($prompt, $default)

The main routine to call interactively read lines. Parameter
I<$prompt> is the text you want to prompt with If it is empty string,
no preceding prompt text is given. It is I<undef> a default value of
"INPUT> " is used.

Parameter I<$default> is the default value; it can be can be
omitted. The next input line is returned or I<undef> on EOF.

=cut

sub readline {
  shift;
  &Term::ReadLine::Perl5::readline::readline(@_);
}

sub editModeFromShell() {
    my @shell_settings = `$ENV{'SHELL'} -c 'set -o'`;
    my $use_vi = grep /vi\ton\n/, @shell_settings;
    return $use_vi ? 'vicmd' : 'emacs';
}

$editMode = 'emacs';
eval {$editMode = editModeFromShell};

=head3 new

B<new>(I<$name>,[I<IN>[,I<OUT>]])

returns the handle for subsequent calls to following functions.
Argument is the name of the application.  Optionally can be followed
by two arguments for C<IN> and C<OUT> file handles. These arguments
should be globs.

I<$name> is the name of the application.

This routine may also get called via
C<Term::ReadLine-E<gt>new($term_name)> if you have
C<$ENV{PERL_RL}> set to 'Perl5';

At present, because this code has lots of global state, we currently don't
support more than one readline instance.
